# VP_project
Kinematics of mechanism - task for exam

The aim of the project is to create automatic generator of geometry for Four-bar linkage mechanism. The geometry set is crated randomly for each iteration which ensures that each student will get unique set of data. Program also calculates the velocity of a given joint. The aim of the exam is to create 3D model in Siemens NX software ane perform kinematic analysis. The final score will be based on comparision between students analysis result and Python script output
