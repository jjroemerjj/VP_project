# VP_project
Kinematics of mechanism - task for exam


The aim of the project is to create automatic
generator of geometry for Four-bar linkage mechanism.
The geometry set is crated randomly for each iteration which
ensures that each student will get unique set of data. Program
also calculates the velocity of a given joint. The aim
of the exam is to create 3D model in Siemens NX software
ane perform kinematic analysis. The final score will
be based on comparision between students analysis result and Python script output
